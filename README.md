Python client package for [APIClarity](https://github.com/openclarity/apiclarity) interaction.

[APIClarity](https://github.com/openclarity/apiclarity) is a modular tool that addresses several aspects of API Security, focusing specifically on [OpenAPI based APIs](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html). APIClarity approaches API Security in 2 different ways:

  * Captures all API traffic in a given environment and performs a set of security analysis to discover all potential security problems with detected APIs
  * Actively tests API endpoints to detect security issues in the implementation of such APIs.
